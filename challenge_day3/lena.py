    return "I am Lena, a mighty dragon from the mid east-west of Estonia. I reside with my closest companion Joana. I have many desirers amongst the sirens (Kaisa) and mermaids (Klaudia) but noone can have my heart as long as my Joana's in the picture. We often descend upon the open sea, far from the coastlines of civilization, while Joana casts spells, darkening the skies, with my wings shaking the earth as we're soaring, flying, there's not a star in the sky that we can't reach. This quirky fruit bat Maliah has even been teaching be robot dancing recently. I think I'm getting pretty good, I would love to find someone to dance battle to Polish my skills."

    return "In a cold November night, right as Joana the witch and I, the stupid-silly dragon had gotten home from our handmade sushi sand on the coast, where we had been selling record amounts of sushi to the mermaids (Klaudia) and sirens (Kaisa) recently, I felt the the hairs on my back stand up. There was an intruder nearby. I took flight and found a knight (Leon) approaching the hut from the north-south side. Destiny had foretold that a knight was going to come from exactly that angle and we would have to fight until the death. As my passion for robot dancing was growing by the minute thanks to learning new moves from the fruitbat Maliah the previous day, I thought I would give the measly boy another chance at life. I landed next to him to offer to settle this grave error in approaching my Lover's hut with a civilized dance battle instead. To my surprise, he managed to challenge me to a duel before I could get any words out, enraging me to madness thus I breathed fire, turning the site into a playground of destruction. I was going to obliterate him one way or another."

    return "I wonder if the knight noticed by cool robo dancing skills as I was giving him the final blows. Our battle helped me feel really comfortable with my big chunky body and I felt free to try all the new moves I've never showed anyone else before. I the The dragon proceeds to challenge the knight to a robot dance off in order to win the advances of the mermaid. He looses as his body is too large and stiff to properly liken a robot. Not enough to impress the startled mermaid. Better luck next time."
