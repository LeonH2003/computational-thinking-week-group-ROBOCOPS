    return "I am Joana, I am know for having curly hair and bangs. Therefore, I am the witch here to destroy everyone that comes acroesss my path. Be careful cuz I HAVE NOOOOO Mercy amd my dragon Lena will burn youuuu with its gays!!! Especially if you're a knight called Leon. I love watching her destroy knights. It gives me immense pleasure. They don't have a chance against my beauty. With all my minions, I hold more power than anyone could ever know, even the fruitbats, my most evil one being Mailiah, keep an ear out for me in the case of any inproper disruptions. It's either my way or no other way, they know to make sure of that. The sea life has been getting on my nerves lately, thank god I can feed them all my scraps coated with spells disguised as delicacies from my sushi stand. One time I made this zoomer mermaid Klaudia and this boomer siren Kaisa fight over a piece of seaweed, it was hilarious. I think they are still fighting over it to this day." 
def act2():
    return "Recently, I ran into this mythical siren called Kaice. She had this bright pink and blue hair and annoying little spirit. She beilves everything is a game and she is always playing around. I tried to be nice to her but she just kept annoying me. Maybe my dragon Lena can help me get rid of her. What's taking her so long? Instead of fulfilling destiny and fighting the knight Leon, she's probably out there learning new dance moves from that fruitbat Maliah. Ugh, what is that even good for? Is she still trying to pull that stubborn mermaid Klaudia? Whatever, I need to get rid of this siren before my nerves blow. I will have to do it myself. I will use my magic powers to get rid of her once and for all. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
def act3():
    return "DAMMM IT, why do I have to do everything myself?? My dragon is useless, just keeps dancing all day, with no sight of Leon the knight! my dragon is busy trying with another knight. When will the knights learn that they can never win against my dragon. I am the most powerful witch in the land. I will have to deal with this annoying ice creature on my own. I will use my magic powers to get rid of her once and for all. MWAHAHAHA. With this spell she will become and eltric eel so that she can nver be playful without hurthing them! MWAHAHAHA"
