    return "I am Klaudia, a mermaid of the Coraleo Sea-Kingdom, dwelling â€™neath the briney deeps where corals rise as towers and pearls glister as stars of night. I drift through the waters with ease, my black hair flowing behind me as the moonlight slips down through the surface, breaking into silver light all around. The dolphins swim at my side in play, and the small fish sing their long, cheerful songs that echo through the vast halls of the sea, with my best friend, dragon Lena, flying above me. Lena is in love with her best friend Joana from monster-High, the school they both attended decades ago. They keep each other safe no matter the cost. It warms my heart to hear about their adventures amongst the land and the sky where they meet different fruit bats like Maliah, sirens like Kaice, and knights like Leon together."

    return "It was a dark Wednesday night, and while I, Klaudia, was swimming near the coast looking for my favourite sushi stand hosted by the best-friends-to-lovers-trope representatives Joana and Lena, I saw a beauitful looking fruit bat. She was glistening in the moonlight and her wings were spread wide. I was mesmerized by her beauty and I swam closer to get a better look. Suddenly, she looked at me and smiled. I felt my heart skip a beat. Her name was Maliah and she was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. She was following a rainbow electric eel reminding me a bit of Kicea and asked me to join her on her quest. We drifted off into the distance of Coraleo while the sea bubbled from turbulences coming from far-far away. We were getting messages of the fruit stock market going crazy because of a mere knight called Leon! The world on land works in curious ways..."

    return "The next week on a sunny Monday afternoon, I arrived to the coast of Lisbon and while I was listening to Will Smith on my streampods I met an electric eel named Kaisa! She was a glistening silver-purple colour that was just absolutely gorgeous. I found that she was a proud mother of twelve young children. I just love to meet people and add them to my army. It was a good thing the whole underworld was following in her tail so they all signed up to be a part of my secret sushi society. Snowball effect! There was even the silly witch Joana with its pet dragon Lena! How goals!!! I love queer cross-species romance! I hope to expand it even further except for that stupid knight Leon who caused the crash of '89. If he'd have won maybe I'd have let him smash but nah, I need to remember my main life goal of ruling the whole wide world one day..."
