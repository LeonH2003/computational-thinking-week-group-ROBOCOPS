    return "I am a glitchy siren called iCE. You see me and you see me not. I live beneath foamy shores, in the depths of the Baltic sea. I can only say one thing: 'Follow the electric eel.' My best friend, a fruit bat, carries my message to and from the stars."


def act2():
    return "Follow the white rabbit, iCE whispers to the wind. Maliah disperses the message with all her fruity might. (POWER TO THE GAYS!) The land and the seas grow alive with turmoil. The sky darkens, the seas rise. The world is changing. The witch and her dragon are after me. I need to be careful. They might eat me!"


def act3():
    return "In the chaos, iCE's call is mystically answered. Ancient creatures of the fruity forest and the stormy seas rally together, united by the message of the electric eel. The boundaries between land and sea blur as they come together to face the impending storm."
