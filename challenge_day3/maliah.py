    return "Hello, I'm Maliah, I am a fruit bat. I like fruits and sleeping. I sleep in fruit trees that are at least two meters tall. My favourite fruit is raspberry. I love swimming to the Baltic sea every morning and watching the pretty mermaids (Klaudia) and sirens (Kaisa). I watch my neigbors all day and I whisper spells that catch their ears in my sleep. Others often end up in in sticky situations because of my sleep talk hehehe --- I recall something about an electric eel in the past months but my memory is hazy... I neighbor with the witch (Joana) and its stupid pet dragon (Lena). Sometimes lost knights (Leon) stumble through our forest too... "

    return "Today, I, the fruitbat, was putting my ear against the sea and I heard a lot of electricity bubbling up... eek!! I looked around and found this group of magnificent electric eels (Kaisa foreshadowing) flowing by and followed them around as they soared through the water. They were showing me all the colors of the rainbow! The rest of my fruitbat friends were fussing about some kind of battle between a wicked witche's dragon (Joana & Lena) and a lost knight (Leon), completely missing the colour show on the water surface. I was stopped by the song of a beautiful mermaid nearby, and she introduced herself as Klaudia. She told me that a lost siren had been swimming amongst them throughout the night, how curious..."

    return "I, the fruitbat, think that maybe all fruit bats should evolve to be in the ocean and grow water parts so they can be friends with the sirens and their mind bending abilities and the mermaids in touch with the cycles of the moooooon. We shall see."
