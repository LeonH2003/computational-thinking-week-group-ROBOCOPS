    return "I am a glitchy siren called iCE. You see me and you see me not. I live beneath foamy shores, in the depths of the Baltic sea. I meet many lost knights like Leon on their travels.  I can only say one thing: 'Follow the electric eel.' My words have the power to wipe minds. My best friend, a fruit bat called Maliah, carries my message to and from the stars. Everyone from the witch of the wild west Joana with her pet dragon Lena, to the mermaid Klaudia of the mediterranean have heard my compelling whispers."


def act2():
    return "Follow the electric eel, kaiCE whispers to the wind. Maliah disperses the message with all her fruity might. (POWER TO THE GAYS!) The sky with the dragon Lena, the land with the knights like Leon and the witch Joana, and the seas with the mermaids like Klaudia grow alive with turmoil. The sky darkens, the seas rise. The world is changing. Lightning strikes into the sea next to me. Surrounded by bubbles, I hear a message echo through my head, as if from the stars themselves: 'The witch and her dragon are after youuuuuuuu...'. Uh oh!! Clutch your wigs, we gotta be careful! I could get eaten by dinner time!"


def act3():
    return "In the chaos of the destined, deadly battle between Leon and the Witch Joana's pet dragon Lena, KaiCE's message, spread by the Mighty Maliah, finally becomes clear in the ears of its recipients. Ancient creatures of the fruity forest and the stormy seas rally together, united by the mystery of finding the all-powerful electric eel. Klaudia is shaken up by this experience and thinks of residing somewhere calmer. The boundaries between land and sea blur as they come together to face the impending storm. The eel must be found and followed word for word without question. That is the only way to restore order in the world. Kaice, now hazed by the recent transition follows Klaudia around to find clarity of the situation."
