    return "I am Lena, a mighty dragon from the mid east-west of Estonia. I reside with my closest companion Joana. I have many desirers amongst the sirens like Kaisa and mermaids like Klaudia but noone can have my heart as long as my Joana's in the picture. We often descend upon the open sea, far from the coastlines of civilization, while Joana casts spells, darkening the skies, with my wings shaking the earth as we're soaring, flying, there's not a star in the sky that we can't reach. This quirky fruit bat Maliah has even been teaching be robot dancing recently. I think I'm getting pretty good, I would love to find someone to dance battle to Polish my skills. Imagine my battle with the mighty Leon as the wise ancients foretold is actually a dance battle. I want to attend dance school..."

    return "During a cold November night, right as Joana, the witch, and I, the stupid-silly dragon, had gotten home from our handmade sushi sand on the coast, where we had been selling record amounts of trout to the mermaids and sirens, the top eaters definitely being Klaudia and Kaisa. I felt the the hairs on my back stand up. There was an intruder nearby. I took flight and found a knight Leon approaching the hut from the north-south side. Ancient scrolls from the library of Alexandria had foretold that a knight called Leon was going to come from exactly that angle and we would have to fight until the death. As my passion for robot dancing was growing by the minute thanks to learning new moves from the fruitbat Maliah the previous day, I thought I would give the measly boy another chance at life. I landed next to him to offer to settle this grave error in approaching my Lover's hut with a civilized dance battle instead. To my surprise, he managed to challenge me to a duel before I could get any words out, enraging me to madness. I breathed fire, turning the site into a playground of destruction. I was going to obliterate him one way or another."

    return "I wonder if the knight Leon noticed by cool robo-dancing skills as I was giving him the final blows. Our battle helped me feel really comfortable with my big chunky body and I felt welcome to try all the new moves I'd been learning in the reflection of the lake and never showed anyone else before. I was use to my nervousness skyrocketing, when I was trying to rizz up this baddie mermaid Klaudia who swam by once, as well as this electric siren Kicea who I was trying to make Joana jealous with in moments when she was giving too much attention to the toads. The battle alleviated my fears slowly but surely, so the our battle switched into a flow state of dancing for me halfway through. Maliah had watched me the whole time with awe and her companions hyped me up even more. I'm grateful for my forest friends. If only Joana had witnessed this... I think she was busy brewing her evening tea... when will she notice me?"
